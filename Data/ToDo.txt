Todo:
 - Port Level Description
 - Port GameOver screen
 - make use of load value
 - ensure different resolutions (widescreen on some iphones result in blue spacing outside default gameview)
 - wind animation
 - rework levels (remove test levels :) )
 

Idea:
 - stabilize ship on high sea
 - loose container
 - multiple ships
 - different containers? liquid?

 
Nice to have:

 - Easter-egg with small button that triggers an event / sound




Done:
 - HighSeas: Make Progress dsiplay, rotation & resolution stabil
 - multiple audio sources for effects
